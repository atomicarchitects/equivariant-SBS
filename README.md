# Equivariant symmetry breaking sets
### Symmetry breaking examples
Code for our symmetry breaking examples are written in Jupyter notebooks and can be found in the Notebooks folder
### Counterexample showing exact partial SBS is not always better
Code for verifying our counterexample in Appendix G can be found in the GAP_script folder
Installation instructions for GAP can be found here https://www.gap-system.org/Download/
To run the GAP script:
- open a terminal in the GAP_script folder
- run `gap` to start GAP in the terminal
- run `Read("counterexample.g");` to run our script
